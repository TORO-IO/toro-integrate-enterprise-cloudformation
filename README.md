# TORO Integrate Enterprise CloudFormation Template

The AWS CloudFormation Template for TORO Integrate Enterprise Edition offers enterprise customers 
a simple way to configure a three tier scalable architecture that leverages all of the benefits of 
AWSâ€™s extensive range of services. The template was designed, built, and tested by the same 
experts that manage the TORO Cloud infrastructure on AWS.
